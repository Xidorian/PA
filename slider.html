        <p>For me, as a diver and as a person, it is very important and a privilege to collaborate and be part of Project AWARE to conserve and protect marine life. It is part of us, our nature and what we are. Since we are responsible for its destruction. I am proud to do my part in trying to save what others are bent on destroying. Thanks to this great team that works to perserve the ocean and everything lives within.</p>

        <p>Our world is called the blue planet for a reason. All life began in the oceans and they still host the majority of life today. But this diverse ecosystem is threatened more and more every day by pollution and debris. As a diver I am privileged to see the wonders underwater and I feel responsible to help save our oceans and all its inhabitants for future generations and for the future of our planet.</p>
